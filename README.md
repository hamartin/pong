# pong
The game pong, written in Python3 using the pygame SDL wrapper

You move the paddles with the W, S and UP and Down keys.
You start the the ball with space.


## TODO

Since, the game currently, doesn't get any harder as time goes by,
the idea is to increase the velocity of the ball the longer
the two players are able to keep the ball going forth and back.
